## Objectives

* identify and remove duplicates from dataset

### Dataset description, usage and requirements
You learn how to identify and deduplicate records in a *<XYZ> dataset*. This dataset is based on the <DATASET1> and <DATASET2>. Weâ€™ve combined the *<DATASET1>* and *<DATASET2>* into a single file with a new column that indicates the source of each record

#### Exercise

1. Catalog your data with the AWS Glue Data Catalog.
2. Create a new FindMatches ML transform for your data.
3. Teach FindMatches by providing labeling examples of matching and non-matching records.
4. Review match quality metrics and upload more labels if match quality is not yet sufficient.
5. Create an AWS Glue ETL job that uses your FindMatches transform.
6. Review the output.
