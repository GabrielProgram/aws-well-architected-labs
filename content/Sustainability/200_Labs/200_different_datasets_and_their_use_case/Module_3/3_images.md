## Objectives

* Compression trade offs

### Data description and requirements

* Labelled images dataset used to train a machine learning model and kept for future research purposes
* Analyse compression options
* JPEG has quality built into the standard; JPEGs encoded at 70% or so are still sharp and nearly indistinguishable from 100% quality

#### Exercise

1. Measuring usage and size
2. Compressing images
    1. prebuilt app in [Serverless Application Repository](https://eu-central-1.console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home?region=eu-central-1#/create/app?applicationId=arn:aws:serverlessrepo:us-east-1:233054207705:applications/compress) that can handle basic image compression
3. Delete uncompressed image
4. Review the outcome
