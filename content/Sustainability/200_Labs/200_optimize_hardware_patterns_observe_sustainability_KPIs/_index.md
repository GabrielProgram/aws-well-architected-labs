## Introduction

This lab focuses on optimizing hardware patterns for sustainability by minimizing the amount of resources required to efficiently deploy your workload.

## Well-Architected Best Practices
This lab helps you to exercise the following AWS Well-Architected Best Practices for Sustainability:

* [SUS05-BP01](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/sustainability-pillar/sus_sus_hardware_a2.html) - **Use the minimum amount of hardware to meet your needs**
* [SUS06-BP01](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/sustainability-pillar/sus_sus_dev_a2.html) - **Adopt methods that can rapidly introduce sustainability improvements**

## Goals
At the end of this lab you will:

* Understand [design principles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/sustainability-pillar/design-principles-for-sustainability-in-the-cloud.html) in the AWS Well-Architected Sustainability Pillar 
* Understand [best practices for hardware patterns](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/sustainability-pillar/hardware-patterns.html) in the AWS Well-Architected Sustainability Pillar
* Learn how to optimize your architecture for minimum amount of hardware usage using [AWS Compute Optimizer](https://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/aws-cost-optimization/right-sizing/)
* Learn how to use [Amazon CloudWatch  metric math](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/using-metric-math.html) feature to observe **[sustainability key performance indicators (KPIs)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/sustainability-pillar/evaluate-specific-improvements.html#key-performance-indicators)**.
