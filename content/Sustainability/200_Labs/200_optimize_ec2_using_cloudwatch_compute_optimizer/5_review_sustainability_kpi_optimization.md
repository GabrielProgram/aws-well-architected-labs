# Overview

With optimization completed in the previous lab, letâ€™s see if you maximized utilization and improved our sustainability KPI:

### 5.1. Applying Hardware Patterns best practices for sustainability in the cloud

1. As discussed earlier, AWS Graviton3 processors helps you reduce your carbon footprint as it uses up to 60 % less energy for the same performance comparable to EC2 instances. With c7g.large instance, CPU utilization appears to be 85%, which means we maximized compute resources.

2. Optimal compute resources to reduces idle resources and to meet performance requirements to deliver your business outcomes


### 5.2. Review Sustainability KPI Optimization

1. Now, let evaluate the improvements by checking KPIs again:
![Section5 revised_kpi_metrics](/Sustainability/200_optimize_ec2_using_cloudwatch_compute_optimizer/Images/section5/revised_kpi_metrics.png)


With, that below are revised (improved) metrics and KPI:

        * Proxy Metric - Total number of vCPUs = 2
        * Business Metric - Total number of APIs = 3
        * KPI - Per request vCPU = 2 / 3 requests = 0.66666 

Improved Sustainability KPI value appears to be **0.66666**.
Your workload shows an initial improvement of 50% reduction in compute resource requirements after changing Amazon EC2 instance type from t4g.xlarge to c7g.large.

For better adoption across organization, you have these CloudWatch dashboards available across teams and publish this data as a continuing success story.

Next, we will clean up the AWS resources created to make sure no further costs are incurred.
