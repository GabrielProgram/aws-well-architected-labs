## Introduction

The outcomes of this lab are:
1. To give you an overview of what proxy metrics are and what you need to think about when selecting them.
2. Identifying proxy metrics and using them from your AWS cost and usage report.
3. Preparing this data in a way that can be queried for dashboarding later.
4. Learning how to bring your own data in the form of assumptions.


## Well-Architected Best Practices
This lab helps you to exercise the following AWS Well-Architected Best Practices for Sustainability:

* [SUS06-BP01](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/sustainability-pillar/sus_sus_dev_a2.html) - **Adopt methods that can rapidly introduce sustainability improvements**

## Goals
At the end of this lab you will:

* Understand the need for proxy metrics for sustainability and identify candidates
* Draw these proxy metrics from your AWS Cost & Usage Report (or sample data) and prepare the data ready for dashboarding with e.g. Amazon QuickSight
* Learn how you can add your own data and combine it with the AWS Cost & Usage Reports
