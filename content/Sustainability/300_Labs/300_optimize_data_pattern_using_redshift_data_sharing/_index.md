## Introduction

This lab focuses on optimizing data patterns for sustainability, specifically focused on removing unneeded or redundant data, and minimizing data movement across networks.

## Well-Architected Best Practices
This lab helps you to exercise the following AWS Well-Architected Best Practices for Sustainability:

* [SUS04-BP05](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/sustainability-pillar/sus_sus_data_a6.html) - **Remove unneeded or redundant data**
* [SUS04-BP07](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/sustainability-pillar/sus_sus_data_a8.html) - **Minimize data movement across networks**
* [SUS06-BP01](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/sustainability-pillar/sus_sus_dev_a2.html) - **Adopt methods that can rapidly introduce sustainability improvements**

## Goals
At the end of this lab you will:

* Understand how to identify optimization areas using AWS Well-Architected Sustainability Pillar best practices
* Baseline and optimize workloads by identifying sustainability key performance indicators (KPIs)
* Learn how to use the Amazon Redshift Data Sharing feature to implement [data management best practices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/sustainability-pillar/data-patterns.html) described in [AWS Well-Architected Sustainability Pillar](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/sustainability-pillar/sustainability-pillar.html)
