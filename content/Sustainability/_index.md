## Introduction
Environmental sustainability is a shared responsibility between customers and AWS. AWS is responsible for sustainability **of** the cloud; delivering efficient, shared infrastructure, water stewardship and sourcing renewable power. Customers are responsible for sustainability **in** the cloud, optimizing workloads and resource utilization.

The labs in this workshop focus on sustainability **in** the cloud.

### Sustainability in the cloud
Sustainability in the cloud is a continuous effort focused primarily on energy reduction and efficiency across all components of a workload by achieving the maximum benefit from the resources provisioned and minimizing the total resources required. This effort can range from the initial selection of an efficient programming language, adoption of modern algorithms, use of efficient data storage techniques, deploying to correctly sized and efficient compute infrastructure, and minimizing requirements for high-powered end-user hardware.

### Design principles for sustainability in the cloud
Apply these design principles when architecting your cloud workloads to maximize sustainability and minimize impact.
* Understand your impact
* Establish your sustainability goals
* Maximise utilization
* Anticipate and adopt new, more efficient hardware and software offerings
* Use managed services
* Reduce the downstream impact of your cloud workloads
