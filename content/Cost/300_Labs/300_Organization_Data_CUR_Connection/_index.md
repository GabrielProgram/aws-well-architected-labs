## Introduction
This lab will show you how to combine your organizations information with your AWS Cost & Usage Report, this will enable you to view cost & usage in a way that is more relevant to your organization. It will guide you through the process of setting up an AWS Lambda function to extract the data from AWS Organizations, such as account ID and name, and place it into Amazon S3. From there, Amazon Athena will be able to read this data to produce a table that can be connected to your AWS Cost & Usage Report to enrich it.
