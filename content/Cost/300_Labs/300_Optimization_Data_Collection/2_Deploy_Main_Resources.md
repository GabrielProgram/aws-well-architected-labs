### Create Reusable Resource

The first step is to create a set of reusable resources and respective data collection modules. 


1.  Click [Launch CloudFormation template](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home#/stacks/new?&templateURL=https://aws-well-architected-labs.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Cost/Labs/300_Optimization_Data_Collection/Optimization_Data_Collector.yaml) if you are deploying to your Cost Optimization linked account (recommended)

Or if you wish to keep this on your local machine please copy [CloudFormation template](https://aws-well-architected-labs.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Cost/Labs/300_Optimization_Data_Collection/Optimization_Data_Collector.yaml) locally and deploy with your preferred method of choice:

{{% notice note %}}
For the CodeBucket Parameter, if deploying in Oregon leave as CodeBucket: aws-well-architected-labs
{{% /notice %}}

2. Click **Next**.

3. Call the stack **OptimizationDataCollectionStack** and fill Deployment parameters. The Role mentioned in **Multi Account Role Name** parameter will be deployed in the next step.
 Select the **Code bucket** for the region you are deploying in and fill **Management account Id**. You have the option to change the name of your access roles, if you do please make the same changes in the **Role for Management Account** and the  **Read Only roles for Data Collector** deployments.
 
 Under available modules section select modules which you would like to deploy. Detailed description of each module can be found [here](../3_data_collection_modules)
 Click **Next** and **Next again**
