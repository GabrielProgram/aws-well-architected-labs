### Query Format Overview

Below is an overview of the key elements of an Athena Query.

The **SELECT** statement is used to select data you require and the **FROM** specifies which table from which database.

Each column from the data you would like returned is placed between the SELECT and the FROM separated by a comma.

The **AS** command is used to rename a column or table with an alias.

The **WHERE** clause is used to filter records. The WHERE clause is used to extract only those records that fulfil a specified condition. For example
<em>WHERE year = '2020'</em>

The **GROUP BY** clause divides the output of a SELECT statement into groups of rows containing matching values. A simple GROUP BY clause may contain any expression composed of input columns or it may be an ordinal number selecting an output column by position (starting at one).

The **ORDER BY** clause is used to sort a result set by one or more output expressions. These can be ascending **ASC** or descending **DESC**.


#### Additional Functions

The **CASE** statement goes through conditions and returns a value when the first condition is met (like an IF-THEN-ELSE statement). So, once a condition is true, it will stop reading and return the result. If no conditions are true, it returns the value in the ELSE clause. 

We may use this to add information to the Athena query based on what results we get back. The example below shows how we have added the Spot Instance item into the data if there is nothing in the pricing term column. 

    CASE pricing_term 
        WHEN 'Reserved' THEN 'Reserved Instance'
        WHEN 'OnDemand' THEN 'OnDemand'
        WHEN '' THEN 'Spot Instance'
        ELSE 'Other'
    END AS Reservation

The **CAST()** function converts a value (of any type) into a specified datatype. This is often use to change a column that's is a **Double** to a **Decimal**. This is because a Double is used for binary and decimal floating-point arithmetic whereas a Decimal is more useful for financial reporting. You can see this in the example below.

    CAST(line_item_unblended_cost AS decimal(16,8))

The **SUM()** function returns the total sum of a numeric column. This is often used to calculate the total spend on a service to give you a complete total.

    SUM(CAST(line_item_unblended_cost AS decimal(16,8)))

The **ROUND()** function rounds a number to a specified number of decimal places.

### Cost Data - Understanding Cost Data
Each customer is unique and so are your needs when it comes to viewing and reporting on cost data. 

Unblended and blended costs allow customers with consolidated billing to understand their cost and usage in management payer and linked member accounts. Unblended costs refers to the cost incurred for the usage by an individual account while blended costs refers to costs within a consolidated billing family looking at the total usage for all accounts compared to the linked member account's usage. The ability to view linked account's unblended cost data allows you to more easily reconcile your charges across your payer and linked accounts. [1]

The amortized cost metric reflects the effective cost of the upfront and monthly reservation fees spread across the billing period. By default, Cost Explorer shows the fees for Reserved Instances and Savings Plans as a spike on the day that you're charged, but if you choose to show costs as amortized costs, the costs are amortized over the billing period.

Amortization, simply stated is breaking down cost into an effective daily rate and enables you to see your costs in accrual-based accounting as opposed to cash-based accounting. For example within the context of a Reserved Instance, if you pay $365 for an All Upfront RI for one year and you have a matching instance that uses that RI, that instance costs you $1 a day, amortized.  Unblended and blended costs would be instead report on the full initial $365 cost on the day of purchase. [2]

In the Well-Architected Labs CUR Query Library we are focused on examples showing unblended costs, amortized costs where applicable, and if applicable we will show true-up and upfront fee columns to allow you to calculate and visuallize the difference between unblended and amortized costs.

#### Unblended vs Blended vs Amortized vs Net

##### Unblended/Blended – Consolidated Billing / Management Accounts with Linked Member Accounts 
Applicable to Reserved Instances, Savings Plans, and On-Demand Instance, as well as pricing tiers (e.g. AWS Free Tier and S3 volume tiers). Unblended costs are associated with the current cost of the product, while blended rates are the averaged costs of the Reserved Instances, On-Demand Instances, and pricing tiered products that are used by member accounts in an organization in AWS Organizations. AWS calculates blended costs by multiplying the blended rate for each service with an account's usage of that service. [4] 

##### Amortized
Applicable to Reserved Instances and Savings Plans, amortizing is when you distribute one-time reservation costs across the billing period that is affected by that cost. For example, if you pay $365 for an All Upfront RI for one year and you have a matching instance that uses that RI, that instance costs you $1 a day, amortized.

In Cost Explorer amortized costs are estimated by combining unblended costs with the amortized portion of your upfront and recurring fees. The unused portion of your upfront fees and recurring charges are shown on the first of the month. [5]

##### Net
In some cases, customers operating at scale on AWS may be able to take advantage of specialized discounts. The net unblended costs reflect usage costs after these discounts are applied while the net amortized costs adds additional logic to amortize discount-related information, in addition to your Savings Plans or Reservation-related charges. [3]


### CUR Table Data
You can see the data provided by Billing and Cost Management for you to calculate your unblended and amortized costs in the following Cost and Usage Reports columns.

In CUR many columns are dynamic, and their visibility in Cost and Usage Reports depends on the usage of product in the billing period. [6]  You will need to adjust your queries for RIs and SPs depending on your purchase of these products during the billing period that you are querying.

#### Reserved Instances

##### Unblended
You can use the following columns to understand the unblended costs of your RIs for the billing period. The values for these columns appear for RI line items with reservation_reservation_a_r_n filled in.  Note: When trying to calculate amortized total costs, lineItem/UnblendedCost should be removed for “Fee” line items.

    lineItem/UnblendedCost
     - CUR Column: line_item_unblended_cost
     - Description: Cost on the day that you're charged
     - Operation: Sum/Add
     - Filter: Not needed for Reserved Instances

##### Amortized
You can use the following columns to understand the amortized costs of your RIs for the billing period. The values for these columns appear only for RI subscription line items (also known as “RI Fee” line items) and not for the actual instances using the RIs. [7]
Typically you would add these two columns (reservation_unused_recurring_fee and reservation_unused_amortized_upfront_fee_for_billing_period) together, along with reservation_effective_cost documented below, to get the total amortized total costs.  Additionally you will also need to ignore lineItem/UnblendedCost for “Fee” line items.  See the examples at the bottom of this section for additional clarity.

    reservation/unusedRecurringFee 
     - CUR Column: reservation_unused_recurring_fee
     - Description: Initial upfront RI fee amortized for Partial Upfront RIs and No Upfront RIs
     - Operation: Sum/Add
     - Filter: line_item_line_item_type = 'RIFee'

    reservation/unusedAmortizedUpfrontFeeForBillingPeriod
     - CUR Column: reservation_unused_amortized_upfront_fee_for_billing_period
     - Description: Unused portion of Initial upfront RI fee amortized for Partial Upfront RIs and No 
     - Operation: Sum/Add
     - Filter: line_item_line_item_type = 'RIFee'

    lineItem/UnblendedCost
     - CUR Column: line_item_unblended_cost
     - Description: Cost on the day that you're charged [as filtered, this is the upfront RI fee]
     - Operation: Ignore (set to 0 in calculation)
     - Filter: Where reservation_reservation_a_r_n <> '' and line_item_line_item_type = 'Fee'

If you wish to compare unblended costs to amortized costs you can subtract the following reservation_amortized_upfront_fee_for_billing_period and add in the upfront RI fee from the line_item_unblended_cost, ignored right above in the amortized cost calculation.

    reservation/amortizedUpfrontFeeForBillingPeriod 
     - CUR Column: reservation_amortized_upfront_fee_for_billing_period
     - Description: Initial upfront RI fee amortized for All Upfront RIs and Partial Upfront RIs
     - Operation: Sum/Subtract
     - Filter: line_item_line_item_type = 'RIFee'

The values for these columns appear for actual instances using RIs and represent the Discounted Usage (also known as “DiscountedUsage” line items). [8]

    reservation/EffectiveCost
     - CUR Column: reservation_effective_cost
     - Description: The sum of both the upfront and hourly rate of your RI, averaged into an effective hourly rate.
     - Additional Breakdown of this column: reservation_amortized_upfront_cost_for_usage + reservation_recurring_fee_for_usage
     - Operation: Sum/Add
     - Filter: Where line_item_line_item_type = 'DiscountedUsage'

#### Savings Plans

##### Unblended
You can use the following columns to understand the unblended costs of your SPs for the billing period. The values for these columns appear for SP line items with savings_plan_savings_plan_a_r_n filled in.  When trying to calculate unblended costs, line_item_unblended_cost should be removed for “SavingsPlanNegation” line items. [9]

    lineItem/UnblendedCost
     - CUR Column: line_item_unblended_cost
     - Description: Cost on the day that you're charged
     - Operation: Sum/Add
     - Filter: line_item_line_item_type != 'SavingsPlanNegation'

##### Amortized
You can use the following columns to understand the amortized costs of your SPs for the billing period. The values for these columns appear only for SP subscription line items (also known as “SavingsPlanCoveredUsage” and “SavingsPlanRecurringFee” line items) and not for the actual instances using the SPs.  For the amortized costs you must also ignore “SavingsPlanNegation” and “SavingsPlanUpfrontFee” line items, these can be used to show you the difference between unblended and amortized costs.

Typically you would add these two columns (savings_plan_savings_plan_effective_cost and savings_plan_total_commitment_to_date) together, and subtract the third (savings_plan_used_commitment). See the examples at the bottom of this section for additional clarity. 

    savingsPlan/SavingsPlanEffectiveCost
     - CUR Column: savings_plan_savings_plan_effective_cost
     - Description: Proportion of the SP monthly commitment amount for Upfront and Recurring
     - Operation: Sum/Add
     - Filter: line_item_line_item_type = 'SavingsPlanCoveredUsage'

    savingsPlan/TotalCommitmentToDate
     - CUR Column: savings_plan_total_commitment_to_date
     - Description: The total amortized upfront commitment and recurring commitment
     - Operation: Sum/Add
     - Filter: line_item_line_item_type = 'SavingsPlanRecurringFee'

    savingsPlan/UsedCommitment
     - CUR Column: savings_plan_used_commitment
     - Description: The total dollar amount of the Savings Plan commitment used
     - Operation: Sum/Subtract
     - Filter: line_item_line_item_type = 'SavingsPlanRecurringFee'

If you wish to compare unblended costs to amortized costs you can subtract the following two columns for AmortizedUpfrontCommitmentForBillingPeriod and the lineItem/UnblendedCost fropm the SavingsPlanNegation line items, and finally add the SavingsPlanUpfrontFee fee from the lineItem/UnblendedCost, ignored above in the amortized cost calculation. [10]

    savingsPlan/AmortizedUpfrontCommitmentForBillingPeriod
     - CUR Column: savings_plan_amortized_upfront_commitment_for_billing_period
     - Description: The amount of upfront fee a Savings Plan subscription is costing you.  Applies to all upfront and partial upfront.
     - Operation: Sum/Subtract
     - Filter: line_item_line_item_type = 'SavingsPlanRecurringFee'

    lineItem/UnblendedCost
     - CUR Column: line_item_unblended_cost
     - Description: Cost on the day that you're charged [as filtered, this is the upfront SP fee]
     - Operation: Sum/Subtract
     - Filter: line_item_line_item_type = 'SavingsPlanNegation'

    lineItem/UnblendedCost
     - CUR Column: line_item_unblended_cost
     - Description: Cost on the day that you're charged [as filtered, this is the Savings Plans discount applied]
     - Operation: Sum/Add
     - Filter: line_item_line_item_type = 'SavingsPlanUpfrontFee'

#### Example
The following snippits from the SELECT portion of the SQL query shows you how to put the above documented logic into practical usage.  We will use this same logic across queries where RIs and SPs are used in the CUR query library.  When comparing Cost Explorer unblended costs to your CUR queries, use sum_line_item_unblended_cost.  When comparing Cost Explorer amortized cost to your CUR queries, use amortized_cost.  The ri_sp_trueup and ri_sp_upfront_fees are included in these examples to help you reconcile the difference between unblended and amortized costs.  You will find that sum_line_item_unblended_cost = amortized_cost + ri_sp_trueup + ri_sp_upfront_fees.  We have already taken care of the additions and subtractions in the values, so you can just add them together.

{{% markdown_wrapper %}}
We will learn how to find out what data is available for querying in the CUR files, this will show what columns there are.Let’s discuss a couple common examples when exploring the CUR dataset. 

#### Example 1 - Answers the question “What are all the columns and data in the CUR table?”

        SELECT *
        FROM${table_name}
        LIMIT 10; 

This is helpful when trying to understand what data is available in the CUR. Use the CSV Export functionality in Athena to obtain a copy of the query results making it is easier to see all of the columns and data.

If you are interested in just the column name, you can use the [DDL statement: SHOW TABLES IN $your table name](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/language-reference.html). 

#### Example 2 - Answers the question of “What are all the columns from the CUR, where a specific value is in the column?”

        SELECT * 
        FROM ${table_name}
        WHERE "line_item_line_item_type" LIKE '%Usage%’
        LIMIT 10; 

This is a helpful technique when searching for a particular Charge Type. Take note that the column values are case sensitive.

#### Example 3 - Answers the question “What services are available in my CUR?”
        SELECT DISTINCT "line_item_product_code" 
        FROM ${table_name}
        LIMIT 10;

This query shows the available services within your CUR. The SELECT DISTINCT statement is helpful when looking for unique values in a specific column. 

The column product_product_name contains similar information and would be a better choice for querying if you are looking for third party marketplace products since line_item_product_code provides a unique id. Be advised that when using the column product_product_name certain line_item_line_item_type's (EdpDiscount,
PrivateRateDiscount) do not populate this column.

#### Example 4 - Answers the question "What billing periods are available?"
        SELECT distinct bill_billing_period_start_date 
        FROM ${table_name}
        LIMIT 10;

Additional helpful getting started queries can be found in the in [200 level Cost and Usage Analysis Lab](https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/cost/200_labs/200_4_cost_and_usage_analysis/3_cur_analysis/).

{{< expand "Filtering Query Results" >}}

{{% markdown_wrapper %}}
Filtering query results will allow for precise data retrieval. The WHERE clause is used to extract only those records that fulfill a specified condition. Let’s review an example where we match a filtered Cost Explorer view with a CUR query to achieve the same results. 

        WHERE year = '2020' AND (month BETWEEN '8' AND '10') 
        AND product_product_name = ('AWS Glue') AND line_item_usage_type LIKE '%Crawler%’ 
        AND product_region = 'us-east-1’ 
        AND line_item_line_item_type NOT IN ('Tax','Credit','Refund')

We will explain what the query filter is doing as well as a screenshot of the equivalent filter in Cost Explorer:
* Time frame to be August to October 2020

![Images/cetime.png](/Cost/300_CUR_Queries/Images/Helpers/cetime.png)

* The Service to be AWS Glue
* The region to be us-east-1
* The usage type to include usage like %Crawler%

![Images/cefilter.png](/Cost/300_CUR_Queries/Images/Helpers/cefilter.png)

* To exclude Charge Types like credit, refund, and tax

![Images/cecharge.png](/Cost/300_CUR_Queries/Images/Helpers/cecharge.png)

You can mimic this example using the following query:

[Link to Code](/Cost/300_CUR_Queries/Code/Analytics/gluewrid.sql)

You can configure Cost Explorer like the below screenshot:

![Images/ce.png](/Cost/300_CUR_Queries/Images/Helpers/ce.png)

In Usage Type just type **Crawler** and select all region-Crawler-DPU-Hour entries. 

You should now be able to align the unblended cost for AWS Glue using both CUR and Cost Explorer.  This is a common approach used to validate your CUR query is working as expected.
