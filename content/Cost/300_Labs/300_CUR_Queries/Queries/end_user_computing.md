#### Query Description
AutoStop Workspaces are cost effective when used for several hours per day. If AutoStop Workspaces run for more than 80 hrs per month it is more cost effective to switch to AlwaysOn mode. This query shows AutoStop Workspaces which ran more that 80 hrs in previous month. If usage pattern for these Workspaces is the same month over month it's possible to optimize cost with switching to AlwaysOn mode. For example: Windows PowerPro (8 vCPU, 32GB RAM) bundle in eu-west-1 runs for 400 hrs per month. In AutoStop mode it costs $612/month ($8.00/month + 400 * $1.53/hour) while if used in AlwaysOn mode it would cost $141/month

#### Pricing
