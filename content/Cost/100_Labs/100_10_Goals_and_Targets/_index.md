## Introduction
This lab will be used as a collaboration space for people to learn, contribute and discuss Cost Optimization goals. The goals are categorized according to the W-A questions and best practices. Each goal has a target and supporting information to help explain the goal/target and how you can adapt and use it best for your organization, along with any potential caveats.

The goals and targets listed should be treated as suggestions (some stronger than others!), to help promote thought & discussion - not necessarily direct implementation in your organization.

There is also an optional space to add contacts for the contributor, if you wish to be contacted and open for a discussion you can use this field.
