> **NOTE:** In order to complete the steps below you will need to have at least one Amazon EC2 instance running in your account.

**Amazon CloudWatch** is a native monitoring service for AWS cloud resources and applications that run on AWS. You can use Amazon CloudWatch to collect and track metrics, collect and monitor log files, and set alarms. In addition to Amazon EC2, Amazon CloudWatch can also monitor AWS resources such as Amazon DynamoDB tables, and Amazon RDS DB instances, as well as custom metrics generated by your applications and services, and any log files your applications generate. 

You can [check here a complete list the available CloudWatch metrics for your EC2 instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/viewing_metrics_with_cloudwatch.html) including `CPUUtilization`, `NetworkIn` and `NetworkOut`. By default, each data point covers the 5 minutes that follow the start time of activity for the instance. If you have enabled detailed monitoring, each data point covers the next minute of activity from the start time. Amazon CloudWatch detail monioring may result in additional charges on your account, please [check the Amazon CloudWatch free tier](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing/) for more details.

**Amazon CloudWatch doesn't collect Amazon EC2 instance memory utilization by default**. In order to monitor memory consumption you will need to install a **CloudWatch Agent** to collect system-level metrics across operating systems. We will cover this step in details on the [200 LVL EC2 Right Sizing lab]({{< ref "/Cost/200_Labs/200_AWS_Resource_Optimization" >}}).

#### 1. Log into your AWS console via SSO, go to the **Amazon CloudWatch** service page:

#### 2. Select **EC2** under the **Service Dashboard**:

#### 3. Observe the **Service Dashboard** and all of its different metrics, but focus on **CPU Utilization** and **Network In Average** and **Network Out Average**:

#### 4. Select one of the **EC2** resources by clicking either on the chart line or on the icons to the left of the **resource-id** name:

#### 5. Deselect the **EC2 resource** and now modify the time range on the top right, click **custom** and select the **last 2 weeks**:

#### 6. Navigate to the **CPU Utilization Average** widget, click on the **three dots** on the top right and launch the **View in metrics** page. Using the **Graphed metrics** section try to answer the following questions:

- a. What is the instance with the highest CPU Average?
- b. What is the instance with the highest CPU Max?
- c. What is the instance with the lowest CPU Min?
