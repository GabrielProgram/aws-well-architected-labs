# Culture Checklist
 

### Finance and Culture side:
* Establish a Cloud-Specific General Ledger (GL) account number. COF didn't have this initially, so it was a struggle to understand early year AWS spend, as the costs were posted to a Data Processing GL used for network carrier costs
* Establish norms around SP/RI purchases. E.g. purchased by a central team or local teams, how are benefits spread, etc. Get buy-in from all parties
* Establish an Account to Org structure early (basically the tagging comment above). Have a common language of how teams speak about their workloads (account level, application level, etc)
* Cloud for Finance education early - identify Cloud Finance SMEs to bring them along in the journey.
* Same thing with Accounting - make sure they understand how SP/RI purchases, premium support fees, credits, other one-time items need to be amortized. Get buy-in early. Cleaning up the GL is a giant pain when you inevitably are asked the question two years from now 'how much has our AWS spend grown by Line of Business' and the GL doesn't align
* Education on RI and Savings Plans concepts and purchasing strategies 
* Must have an Ownership strategy
* Have a tagging/allocation method
