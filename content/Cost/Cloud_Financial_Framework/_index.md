Cloud Financial Framework (CFF) provides a structured plan to implement Cloud Financial Managment (CFM) technical activities. 
CFF is based on CFM pillars- **see**, **save**, **plan** and **run**. This allows business organizations to manage, optimize and plan costs as they grow their usage and scale on AWS. The primary goal of CFF is to allow you take active actions to improve your cost and usage on AWS cloud.

CFF is focused on these pillars:
- **[Culture Change](https://catalog.workshops.aws/awscff/en-US/culture-change)**- Creating a cost aware culture inside the orgnization, it requires a cost aware process, monitoring potential costs changes proactively and periodically
- **[Foundations](https://catalog.workshops.aws/awscff/en-US/foundations)**- What tools are you using to track cost & usage on the cloud? Are you able to identify the specific workload and owner based on tags? How do you manage your budget?
- **[Visualizations](https://catalog.workshops.aws/awscff/en-US/visualizations)**- How are you currently measuring, monitoring and creating accountability for your cloud spend? Are you able to drill down to a specific cost? Can you create customs dashboards to meet your organization needs?
