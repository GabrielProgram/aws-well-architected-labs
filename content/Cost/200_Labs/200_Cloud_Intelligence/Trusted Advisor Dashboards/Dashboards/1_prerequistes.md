### Enable Trusted Advisor Data Collection

There are 2 supported data collection methods:
1. **Trusted Advisor API with [Optimization Data Collection lab](https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/cost/300_labs/300_optimization_data_collection/) (recommended)** - provides an automated way to collect Trusted Advisor checks for all accounts in your AWS Organizations via deployment of required AWS resources from provided AWS CloudFormation templates. Supports automated data refresh.
2. **Trusted Advisor Organizational View** - provides an easy way to collect Trusted Advisor checks for all accounts in your AWS Organizations without need to provision any additional resources. Only manual data refresh is supported.


Please choose preferred data collection method and expand respective section below to proceed:

#### Create S3 bucket.

1. Create an S3 bucket with the name `costoptimizationdata{account_id}` in a [QuickSight supported AWS region](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/regions.html) (for example us-east-1)

2. Create new folder `trusted-advisor` and then `trusted-advisor-data` within it so the whole path looks like `s3://costoptimizationdata{account_id}/trusted-advisor/trusted-advisor-data/`.

{{% notice note %}}
You can use any S3 bucket name. Please save {bucket} name. It will be needed in Stage 2
