We always improve Cloud Intelligence Dashboards by adding new actionable insights and recommendations. All new dashboard versions announced in our [Changelog](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-cudos-framework-deployment/blob/main/changes). You can find your current dashboard version on About tab of each of the dashboards.

To pull the latest version of the dashboard from the public template please use the following steps.

1. In CloudShell (or if you prefer your Terminal with credentials into the AWS account), run the following command and make sure you hit enter ```python3 -m ensurepip --upgrade```
2. Then type the following command and press enter ```pip3 install --upgrade cid-cmd``` 
3. Then type the following command and press enter ```cid-cmd update``` 
4. Choose the dashboard you wish to update and press enter.
