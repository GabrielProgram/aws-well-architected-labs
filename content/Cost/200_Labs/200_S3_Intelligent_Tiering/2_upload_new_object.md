New objects uploaded to S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class are initially stored in the Frequent Access Tier and if not accessed until their minimum duration in the standard access tier will be moved to Infrequent Access Tier and further to Archive tier to save cost for infrequently accessed data.

This section walks you through the steps to first create a new S3 bucket and then upload an object to S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class. If you prefer to use an existing bucket for the purpose of this lab, you can skip steps 1 to 4 and go straight to step 5.

1. Log into [AWS Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/). Navigate to Amazon S3 console by typing **S3** in the services search bar and clicking **S3** in the search results.

3. Enter a descriptive name for your bucket. Bucket names are globally unique; if you encounter an error with the name you selected, please try again with a different name. Select an **AWS Region** from the drop down menu where you would like to create your bucket.

You can optionally add a [bucket tag](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/CostAllocTagging.html) to help track costs associated with workloads. AWS uses the bucket tags to organize your resource costs on your [cost allocation report](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/configurecostallocreport.html), to make it easier for you to categorize and track your AWS costs. For more information, see [Using Cost Allocation Tags](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/cost-alloc-tags.html) in the AWS Billing User Guide.
