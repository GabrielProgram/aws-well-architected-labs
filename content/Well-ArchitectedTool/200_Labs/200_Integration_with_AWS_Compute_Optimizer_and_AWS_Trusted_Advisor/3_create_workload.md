## Overview
Well-Architected Reviews are conducted per workload. A workload identifies a set of components that deliver business value. The workload is usually the level of detail that business and technology leaders communicate about. Workloads vary in levels of architectural complexity, from static websites to architectures with multiple data stores and many components.

1. We will start with creating a Well-Architected workload to use throughout this lab. Click **Define workload**.

2. If this is your first time using AWS WA Tool, you see [Defining a workload steps](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/userguide/define-workload.html) that introduces you to the features of the service. Now you can create a new Well-Architected workload:

![Section3 DefiningAWorkload](/watool/200_Integration_with_AWS_Compute_Optimizer_and_AWS_Trusted_Advisor/Images/section3/DefiningAWorkload.png)

The following are the required workload properties:

* workload-name - This is a unique identifier for the workload. Must be between 3 and 100 characters.
* description - A brief description of the workload to document its scope and intended purpose. Must be between 3 and 250 characters.
* review-owner - The name, email address, or identifier for the primary individual or group that owns the review process. Must be between 3 and 255 characters.
* environment - The environment in which your workload runs. This must either be PRODUCTION or PREPRODUCTION
* aws-regions - The aws-regions in which your workload runs (us-east-1, etc).
* lenses - The list of lenses associated with the workload. All workloads must include the "wellarchitected" lens as a base, but can include additional lenses. 

3. We will need a mechanism to allow a user to complete a true workload focused Well-Architected Framework Review rather than all resources in AWS account. When AWS lambda function retrieve cost optimization data, it will also validate if Amazon EC2 Instances are being used for the particular workload that you defined in Well-Architected tool using Amazon Tags before ingesting data points into notes in Well-Architected Tool. Therefore, a reviewer can focus on EC2 Instances used for only the particular workload. Attach the same tags we have attached to Amazon EC2 Instances to this workload. Use **workload** as Key and **wademo** as Value.
AWS Lambda functions will verify if cost optimization data from AWS Compute Optimizer and AWS Trusted Advisor has the same tags as the following tags to ensure Amazon EC2 Instances are being used for this workload.
    ```
    Key = workload
    Value = wademo
    ```

4. Choose the lenses that apply to this workload. **AWS Well-Architected Framework** has been selected by default.
