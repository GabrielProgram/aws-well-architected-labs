Please use the *GitHub issue tracker* to report bugs or suggest features.

When filing an issue, please check [existing open](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-well-architected-labs/issues) or [recently closed](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-well-architected-labs/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aclosed%20) issues to make sure somebody else hasn't already reported the issue. Please try to include as much information as you can. Details like these are incredibly useful:

* A label with the Well-Architected framework pillar (i.e. COST)
* A reproducible test case or series of steps
* The version of our code being used
* Any modifications you have made relevant to the bug
* Anything unusual about your environment or deployment
