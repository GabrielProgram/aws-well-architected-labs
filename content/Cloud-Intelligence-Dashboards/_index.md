The Cloud Intelligence Dashboards is an open-source framework, lovingly cultivated and maintained by a group of customer-obsessed AWSers, that provides customers actionable insights and optimization opportunities at scale of organization. Supported by the Well-Architected framework, the dashboards can be deployed by any customer using a CloudFormation template or a command-line tool in their environment. These dashboards help customers drive financial accountability, optimize cost, track usage goals, implement best-practices for governance, and achieve operational excellence across all Well Architected pillars.
