## Introduction

In this lab we will create a secure data bunker. A data bunker is a secure account which will hold important security data in a secure location. Ensure that only members of your security team have access to this account. In this lab we will create a new security account, create a secure S3 bucket in that account and then turn on CloudTrail for our organisation to send these logs to the bucket in the secure data account. You may want to also think about what other data you need in there such as secure backups.
