In later labs we will query that data to calculate proxy metrics for sustainability.
There are several options to provide AWS Cost &amp;amp; Usage Report data:
Option A: use existing CUR reports from your AWS account. This option makes sense, if you already have configured CUR in your account.</description></item><item><title>Discover CUR data with Amazon Athena</title><link>https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/sustainability/300_labs/300_cur_reports_as_efficiency_reports/1-2_discover_cur_data/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Nov 2020 09:16:09 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/sustainability/300_labs/300_cur_reports_as_efficiency_reports/1-2_discover_cur_data/</guid><description>Lab 1.2 In the previous step, you provided AWS Cost &amp;amp; Usage Report data in an Amazon S3 bucket. In this step you will make this usage data available in the AWS Glue data catalog for Amazon Athena. Amazon Athena allows you to run SQL (Structured Query Language) queries on the data without loading it into a database and calculate proxy metrics for sustainability.
Go to the Amazon Athena console in a region in which your CUR data is stored.</description></item><item><title>Query your Amazon S3 usage by storage class</title><link>https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/sustainability/300_labs/300_cur_reports_as_efficiency_reports/1-3_query_s3_usage_by_class/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Nov 2020 09:16:09 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/sustainability/300_labs/300_cur_reports_as_efficiency_reports/1-3_query_s3_usage_by_class/</guid><description>Lab 1.3 In the previous steps, you learned how you can run SQL queries on your AWS Cost &amp;amp; Usage Report data with Amazon Athena. In this step you will learn how you can aggregate the usage data by type and AWS account. This way you can calculate proxy metrics for sustainability and Key Performance Indicators (KPI) of your application teams.
Let&amp;rsquo;s query the cur_hourly table we just created to get the Amazon S3 storage by account and storage class.</description></item><item><title>Install the AWS Cost and Usage Queries from the AWS Serverless Application Repository</title><link>https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/sustainability/300_labs/300_cur_reports_as_efficiency_reports/1-4_queries_from_sar/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Nov 2020 09:16:09 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/sustainability/300_labs/300_cur_reports_as_efficiency_reports/1-4_queries_from_sar/</guid><description>Lab 1.4 In the previous steps you&amp;rsquo;ve made the AWS Cost &amp;amp; Usage Report data available to Amazon Athena with a lot of manual steps. In this lab you will use sample code to automate this setup and deploy a set of pre-canned queries automatically.
The sample code is packaged and available in the AWS Serverless Application Repository and called AWS Usage Queries (find the source code on GitHub ).</description></item><item><title>Add your own assumptions (using the Amazon Athena console)</title><link>https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/sustainability/300_labs/300_cur_reports_as_efficiency_reports/2_add_assumptions/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Nov 2020 09:16:09 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/sustainability/300_labs/300_cur_reports_as_efficiency_reports/2_add_assumptions/</guid><description>Introduction By now you have queried AWS Cost &amp;amp; Usage reports with Amazon Athena. You drew proxy metrics for sustainability from AWS usage data. Calculating key performance indicators (KPIs), you might want to extend the queries with further assumptions/ data to reinforce sustainable best practices.
Some examples for further assumptions:
preference of one EC2 instance family over another (e.g. AWS Graviton based instances) AWS Region preference by user location or the published carbon intensity of electricity grids preference of EC2 Spot instances to increase the overall utilization of the cloud&amp;rsquo;s resources while decreasing cost In this lab you will learn to make that data available to your queries as a simple view in Amazon Athena.</description></item><item><title>Add your own assumptions (using infrastructure as code)</title><link>https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/sustainability/300_labs/300_cur_reports_as_efficiency_reports/3_add_assumptions_iac/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Nov 2020 09:16:09 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/sustainability/300_labs/300_cur_reports_as_efficiency_reports/3_add_assumptions_iac/</guid><description>Introduction In lab 2 you learned how to extend your AWS Cost &amp;amp; Usage Report data by additional data &amp;amp; assumptions in Amazon Athena views. The manual approach from the previous lab is tedious and not feasible if you need to provide larger data sets. In this lab you learn to add more data in CSVs via an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) approach.
You will customize the library introduced in lab 1.</description></item><item><title>Cleanup</title><link>https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/sustainability/300_labs/300_cur_reports_as_efficiency_reports/cleanup/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Nov 2020 09:16:09 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/sustainability/300_labs/300_cur_reports_as_efficiency_reports/cleanup/</guid><description>To cleanup the resources created by this lab, please follow these steps:
Delete the AWS Cost &amp;amp; Usage Report in the billing console if you have created one for Lab 1.1 . Empty and delete the Amazon S3 bucket if you have created one to store the sample CUR data for Lab 1.1 . Go to the AWS CloudFormation console in the region in which you deployed the AWS Serverless Application Repository application in Lab 1.</description></item></channel></rss>
