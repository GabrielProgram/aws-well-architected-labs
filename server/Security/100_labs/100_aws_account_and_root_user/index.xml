This identity is called the AWS account root user and is accessed by signing in with the email address and password that you used to create the account.
It is strongly recommended that you only use the root user by exception.</description></item><item><title>Tear down</title><link>https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/security/100_labs/100_aws_account_and_root_user/2_cleanup/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Apr 2020 11:16:09 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/security/100_labs/100_aws_account_and_root_user/2_cleanup/</guid><description>Please note that the changes you made to secure your account and root user should remain in place, and have no charges associated with them.</description></item></channel></rss>
