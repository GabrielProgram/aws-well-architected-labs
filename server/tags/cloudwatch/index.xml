Let&amp;rsquo;s add a new widget to our CloudWatch Dashboard. Click on the &amp;ldquo;Add Widget&amp;rdquo; button in the upper right corner. Click Line, then next Click Metrics and then Configure Select &amp;ldquo;PerfLab&amp;rdquo; under Custom Namespaces and then select the second metric group “ImageId, InstanceId, InstanceType” Make sure to search only for the InstanceId if you have multiple machines reporting metrics Find the “mem_used” and &amp;ldquo;mem_total&amp;rdquo; and click the check box next to it Click on “Graphed Metrics (2)” and then select “5 seconds” as the period Click on Create widget You should now see two widgets on your Dashboard You can drag the widgets around the screen and re-size them if you wish You can also change the time period, select 1h to show just the most recent metrics You can also set the auto-refresh rate for the Dashboard by using this pull-down.</description></item><item><title>Level 100: Monitoring an Amazon Linux EC2 instance with CloudWatch Dashboards</title><link>https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/performance-efficiency/100_labs/100_monitoring_linux_ec2_cloudwatch/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Dec 2020 11:16:08 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/performance-efficiency/100_labs/100_monitoring_linux_ec2_cloudwatch/</guid><description>Authors Eric Pullen, Performance Efficiency Lead Well-Architected Introduction This hands-on lab will guide you through creating an Amazon EC2 instance running Amazon Linux and then configuring a Amazon CloudWatch Dashboard to get aggregated views of the health and performance information for that instance.

In order to showcase the dashboards, lets add a synthetic load to the machine.
Stress For this lab, the EC2 instance will install a utility called stress. This tool is designed to subject your system to a configurable measure of CPU, memory, I/O and disk stress.
Stress tools is not installed by default, you will need to install the package in advance:</description></item><item><title>Generate CPU and Memory load</title><link>https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/performance-efficiency/100_labs/100_monitoring_windows_ec2_cloudwatch/5_generating_load/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Nov 2020 12:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/performance-efficiency/100_labs/100_monitoring_windows_ec2_cloudwatch/5_generating_load/</guid><description>We have a CloudWatch dashboard to show us CPU and Memory statistics for the deployed EC2 instance. In order to showcase the dashboards, lets add a synthetic load to the machine. We have 2 PowerShell scripts that have already been deployed to the instance to facilitate this.
cpu_stress.ps1 This script will start multiple threads (one per CPU in the machine) to keep the processor busy doing a simple math computation. We set the thread priority to &amp;ldquo;Lowest&amp;rdquo; so it should still allow system processes to continue.</description></item><item><title>Teardown</title><link>https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/performance-efficiency/100_labs/100_monitoring_linux_ec2_cloudwatch/6_cleanup/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Dec 2020 11:16:08 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/performance-efficiency/100_labs/100_monitoring_linux_ec2_cloudwatch/6_cleanup/</guid><description>Summary In order to monitor your compute resources to ensure they are performing properly, you must record performance related metrics.
