     Use the available elasticity of resources
    </b>
    <br/>
    <li class="listitem">
     Take advantage of
  elasticity
  :
  Elasticity
  matches the supply of resources you have against the demand for those resources.               Instances, containers, and functions provide mechanisms for
  elasticity
  either in combination with automatic scaling or as a feature of the service. Use
  elasticity
  in your
  architecture
  to ensure that you have sufficient capacity to meet
  performance
  requirements at all scales of use.                                         Ensure that the metrics for scaling up or down elastic resources               are validated against the type of
  workload
  being deployed. If you are deploying a video transcoding application, 100% CPU is               expected and should not be your primary metric. Alternatively, you can measure against               the queue depth of transcoding jobs waiting to scale your instance types.                                             Ensure that
  workload
  deployments can handle both scale up and scale down
  events
  . Scaling down
  workload
  components
  safely is as critical as scaling up resources when demand dictates. Create test scenarios               for scale-down
  events
  to ensure that the
  workload
  behaves as expected.
