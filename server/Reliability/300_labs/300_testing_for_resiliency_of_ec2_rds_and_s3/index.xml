The service is a web server running on Amazon EC2 fronted by an Elastic Load Balancer reverse-proxy, with a data store on Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS).

You have a choice of environments from which to execute the failure injections for this lab. Bash scripts are a good choice and can be used from a Linux command line. If you prefer Python, Java, Powershell, or C#, then instructions for these are also provided.</description></item><item><title>Preparation for Failure Injection</title><link>https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/reliability/300_labs/300_testing_for_resiliency_of_ec2_rds_and_s3/3_failure_injection_prep/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Sep 2021 11:16:08 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/reliability/300_labs/300_testing_for_resiliency_of_ec2_rds_and_s3/3_failure_injection_prep/</guid><description>Failure injection is the means by which we will simulate disruptive real-world events that affect production environments. Such events are used in chaos engineering to validate and understand the resiliency of your workload. Chaos engineering is a recommended practice of the AWS Well-Architected Reliability Pillar . Here you will initiate various failure scenarios and assess how your workload reacts.
Before testing, please prepare the following:

Common AWS Account Problems If running these labs on your own, you will need to use an AWS account that meets the following qualifications. If you are at a live workshop, you may have been supplied with an AWS account for the lab. If not, and you cannot remedy your account issues, please see a proctor who can help pair you with another student who does have these permissions and you can “pair lab”.</description></item><item><title>Availability Zone (AZ) Failure Injection Has Been Moved</title><link>https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/reliability/300_labs/300_testing_for_resiliency_of_ec2_rds_and_s3/6_failure_injection_az/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/reliability/300_labs/300_testing_for_resiliency_of_ec2_rds_and_s3/6_failure_injection_az/</guid><description> Go here for AZ failure injection X Lab complete!
