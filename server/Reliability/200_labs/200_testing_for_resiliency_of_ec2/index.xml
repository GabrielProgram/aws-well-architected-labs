If you have already run the following two labs (and have not torn down the resources) then you have already deployed the necessary infrastructure. Proceed to next step Configure Execution Environment

You have a choice of environments from which to execute the failure injections for this lab. Bash scripts are a good choice and can be used from a Linux command line. If you prefer Python, Java, Powershell, or C# instructions for these are also provided.
2.1 Setup AWS credentials and configuration Your execution environment needs to be configured to enable access to the AWS account you are using for the workshop.</description></item><item><title>Test Resiliency Using Failure Injection</title><link>https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/reliability/200_labs/200_testing_for_resiliency_of_ec2/3_failure_injection/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Apr 2020 11:16:09 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/reliability/200_labs/200_testing_for_resiliency_of_ec2/3_failure_injection/</guid><description>Failure injection (also known as chaos testing) is an effective and essential method to validate and understand the resiliency of your workload and is a recommended practice of the AWS Well-Architected Reliability Pillar . Here you will initiate various failure scenarios and assess how your system reacts.
Preparation Before testing, please prepare the following:
Region must be the one you selected when you deployed your WebApp
We will be using the AWS Console to assess the impact of our testing</description></item><item><title>Tear down this lab</title><link>https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/reliability/200_labs/200_testing_for_resiliency_of_ec2/4_cleanup/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Apr 2020 11:16:09 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/reliability/200_labs/200_testing_for_resiliency_of_ec2/4_cleanup/</guid><description>The following instructions will remove the resources that you have created in this lab.
If you deployed the CloudFormation stacks as part of the prerequisites for this lab, then delete these stacks to remove all the AWS resources. If you need help with how to delete CloudFormation stacks then follow these instructions to tear down those resources:
Delete the WebApp resources Wait for this stack deletion to complete Delete the VPC resources Otherwise, there were no additional new resources added as part of this lab.</description></item></channel></rss>
