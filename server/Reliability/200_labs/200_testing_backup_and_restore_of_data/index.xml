Backing up data frequently is of vital importance for the long lasting success of any organization. However, a backup of data is only valuable if data can be recovered/restored from the backup. In the cloud, backing up data and testing the restore is easier compared to on-premises datacenters. Automating this process with appropriate notification systems will ensure that an organization&amp;rsquo;s data is backed up frequently, the backups are tested to ensure expected recovery, and appropriate people are notified in case of failures.</description></item><item><title>Create Backup Plan</title><link>https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/reliability/200_labs/200_testing_backup_and_restore_of_data/2_configure_backup_plan/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Feb 2021 11:16:08 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/reliability/200_labs/200_testing_backup_and_restore_of_data/2_configure_backup_plan/</guid><description>A well thought out backup strategy is key to an organization&amp;rsquo;s success and is determined by a variety of factors. The biggest factors influencing a backup strategy is the Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO) set for the workload. RTO and RPO are determined based on the criticality of the workload to the business, the SLAs that have been agreed upon, and the cost associated with achieving the RTO and RPO.</description></item><item><title>Enable Notifications</title><link>https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/reliability/200_labs/200_testing_backup_and_restore_of_data/3_enable_notifications/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Feb 2021 11:16:08 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/reliability/200_labs/200_testing_backup_and_restore_of_data/3_enable_notifications/</guid><description>In the cloud, setting up notifications to be aware of events within your workload is easily achieved. AWS Backup leverages AWS SNS to send notifications related to backup activities that are occurring. This will allow visibility into backup job statuses, restore job statuses, or any failures that may have occurred, allowing your Operations teams to respond appropriately.
Open a terminal where you have access to the AWS CLI. Ensure that the CLI is up to date and that you have AWS Administrator Permissions to run AWS CLI commands.</description></item><item><title>Test Restore</title><link>https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/reliability/200_labs/200_testing_backup_and_restore_of_data/4_test_restore/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Feb 2021 11:16:08 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/reliability/200_labs/200_testing_backup_and_restore_of_data/4_test_restore/</guid><description>A backup of a data source is useful only if data can be restored from it. If backups aren&amp;rsquo;t tested, you might find yourself in a situation where your workload has been impacted by an event and you need to recover data from your backups, but the backups are faulty and restoring data is not possible, or exceeds your RTO. To avoid such situations, backups taken should always be tested to ensure they can be used to recover data.</description></item><item><title>Teardown</title><link>https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/reliability/200_labs/200_testing_backup_and_restore_of_data/5_cleanup/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Feb 2021 11:16:08 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/reliability/200_labs/200_testing_backup_and_restore_of_data/5_cleanup/</guid><description>The following instructions will remove the resources that you have created in this lab.
Cleaning up AWS Backup Resources Sign in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the AWS Backup console - https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/backup/home?region=us-east-1#home Click on BACKUP VAULTS from the menu on the left side, and select BACKUP-LAB-VAULT. Under the section BACKUPS, delete all the RECOVERY POINTS. Once all the RECOVERY POINTS have been deleted, delete the Backup Vault by clicking on DELETE on the top right hand corner.</description></item></channel></rss>
