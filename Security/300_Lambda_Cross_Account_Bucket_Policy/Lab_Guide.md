1. [Tear Down](#tear_down)

This lab is best runusing two AWS accounts

* Identify the AWS account number for account 1 (no dashes)
* Identify the AWS account number for account 2 (no dashes)

If you only have one AWS account, then use the same AWS account number for both **account1** and **account2**

## 1. Identify (or create) S3 bucket in account 2 <a name="create_bucket_1"></a>

1. In account 2 sign in to the S3 Management Console as an IAM user or role in your AWS account, and open the S3 console at <https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3>
1. Choose an S3 bucket that contains some objects. You will enable the ability to list the objects in this bucket from the other account.
   * If you would rather create a new bucket to use, [follow these directions](Documentation/CreateNewS3Bucket.md)
   * Record the **bucketname**

## 2. Create role for Lambda in account 1 <a name="create_role_1"></a>

1. In account 1 sign in to the AWS Management Console as an IAM user or role in your AWS account, and open the IAM console at <https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/>
1. Click Roles on the left, then create role
1. AWS service will be pre-selected, select **Lambda**, then click **Next: Permissions**
1. Do not select any managed policies, click **Next: Tags**
1. Click **Next: Review**
1. Enter _Lambda-List-S3-Role_ for the Role name then click Create role
1. From the list of roles click the name of **Lambda-List-S3-Role**
1. Click **Add inline policy**, then click **JSON** tab
1. Replace the sample json with the following
    * Replace **account1** with the AWS Account number (no dashes) of account 1
    * Replace **bucketname** with the S3 bucket name from account 2
    * Then click **Review Policy**

            {
                "Version": "2012-10-17",
                "Statement": [
                    {
                        "Sid": "S3ListBucket",
                        "Effect": "Allow",
                        "Action": [
                            "s3:ListBucket"
                        ],
                        "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::bucketname"
                    },
                    {
                        "Sid": "logsstreamevent",
                        "Effect": "Allow",
                        "Action": [
                            "logs:CreateLogStream",
                            "logs:PutLogEvents"
                        ],
                        "Resource": "arn:aws:logs:us-east-1:account1:log-group:/aws/lambda/Lambda-List-S3*/*"
                    },
                    {
                        "Sid": "logsgroup",
                        "Effect": "Allow",
                        "Action": "logs:CreateLogGroup",
                        "Resource": "*"
                    }
                ]
            }

1. Name this policy _Lambda-List-S3-Policy_, then click Create policy

## 3. Create bucket policy for the S3 bucket in account 2 <a name="create_bucket_policy"></a>

1. In account 2 sign in to the S3 Management Console as an IAM user or role in your AWS account, and open the S3 console at <https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3>
1. Click on the name of the bucket you will use for this workshop
1. Go to the **Permissions tab**
1. Click **Bucket Policy**
1. Enter the following JSON policy
     1. Replace **account1** with the AWS Account number (no dashes) of account 1
     1. Replace **bucketname** with the S3 bucket name from account 2
     1. Note: This policy uses least privilege. Only resources using the IAM role from account 1 will have access

            {
                "Version": "2012-10-17",
                "Statement": [
                    {

                        "Action": [
                            "s3:ListBucket"
                        ],
                        "Effect": "Allow",
                        "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::bucketname",
                        "Principal": {
                            "AWS":"arn:aws:iam::account1:role/Lambda-List-S3-Role"
                        },
                        "Condition": {
                            "StringLike": {
                                "aws:UserAgent": "*AWS_Lambda_python*"
                            }
                        }
                    }
                ]
            }

1. Click **Save**

## 4. Create Lambda in account 1 <a name="create_lambda_1"></a>

1. Open the Lambda console <https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda>
1. Click **Create a function**
1. Accept the default **Author from scratch**
1. Enter function name as _Lambda-List-S3_
1. Select **Python 3.7 **runtime
1. Expand Permissions, click **Use an existing role**, then select the **Lambda-List-S3-Role**
1. Click **Create function**
1. Replace the example function code with the following
    * Replace **bucketname** with the S3 bucket name from account 2

          import json
          import boto3
          import os
          import uuid
          
          def lambda_handler(event, context):
              try:
                  
                  # Create an S3 client
                  s3 = boto3.client('s3')
          
                  # Call S3 to list current buckets
                  objlist = s3.list_objects(
                                  Bucket='bucketname',
                                  MaxKeys = 10) 
                  
                  print (objlist['Contents'])
                  return str(objlist['Contents'])
          
          
              except Exception as e:
                  print(e)
                  raise e

1. Click **Save**.
1. Click **Test**, accept the default event template, enter an event name for the test, then click **Create**
1. Click **Test** again, and in a few seconds the function output should highlight green and you can expand the detail to see the response from the S3 API

## 5. Tear down this lab <a name="tear_down"></a>

* Remove the lambda function, then roles
* If you created a new S3 bucket, then you may remove it
